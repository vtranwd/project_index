Productivity App designed as a To-Do List with issue tracking and progress tracking.


MVP
- CREATE To-Do list
- READ To-Do list
- UPDATE To-Do list
- DELETE item from To-Do list
- CRUD operations for whole lists and also for individual items on each list

NEXT STEPS
- create user view and admin view -- or I could just make life easier and add items as HTML but where's the fun in that? Doing this as a full stack operation would make this project so much easier to manage in the long run.
- Create a section for WordPress projects because that's a growing part of my portfolio

ADD-ON FUNCTIONS
- Add color picker to allow color assignments per list, like the sticky notes applet on early Windows 10 PCs.
- Option to move lists up and down in queue
- Dropdown selector to assign priority to each list
- Dropdown selector to assign priority to each list item
- Upload files as list items

ADVANCED GOALS
- Automatically send an email to users when a List has not been modified in X number of days (poking the bear)
- Allow users to set email reminders to automatically send an email if a List has not been modified in X number of days (poking the bear modifier).
